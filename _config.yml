  ### About Passion Talks

  "Passion Talks" are short talks by Christian grad students,
  academics and professionals considering how their faith intersects
  with and impacts their work. Founded in 2012 by Christian grad
  students from UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco, and
  Stanford, Passion Talks is a growing platform for discussing the
  work-faith connection in all disciplines.
