"Passion Talks" are short talks by Christian grad students, academics
and professionals considering how their faith intersects with and
impacts their work. Founded in 2012 by Christian grad students from UC
Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco, and Stanford, Passion Talks
is a growing platform for discussing the work-faith connection in all
disciplines.
