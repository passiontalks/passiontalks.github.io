title: Our Passion Talks Pilot Was a Success!
author: Sherol Chen

Wendy, the new IV Grad Staff worker at Stanford, says "we're going to do
the Christian TED talks." It seemed so arbitrary, like deciding whether
to get whipped cream with my latte. "Really, that's all it takes?" The
answer is a big resounding, "YES, it is that simple!"

This how it happened... (1) we used our Winter Retreat as the venue, (2)
we publicized the opportunity to speak, (3) I made a Google form, (4)
people signed up, (5) I formatted their abstracts/bios into a nice 2
page PDF.

Passion Talks

Now, it wasn't entirely effortless; however, once I made the PDF and
start distributing the draft did it become *real* for most others, and a
couple more people decided they didn't want to miss the Passion Talk
Bus. In the past, we'd been calling these "Reclaim Talks," and then it
became Christian TED-like talks, as it was more descriptive. I took my
own liberty on this, and just branded the event "Passion Talks." People
drove into the Santa Cruz mountains, just for the Passion Talks portion
of the weekend.

When time came around to begin the talk session, hardly anyone was
around. I thought to myself, "can't expect much for a first time thing."
Grad students, especially, are quite cynical when it comes to unfamiliar
or new things. As you can see, I can be quite cynical about grad
students (haha). Before I knew it, the room was nearly full.

The talks were about 10 minutes long, which I think are too short. I
also believe we could have a better discussion arrangement. I, as a grad
student, have been to many conferences and have seen many
speaking/speaker situations. The speakers did a great job and the
audience connected with a variety of topics and the various talks. After
the event, I had a handful of people approach me about my work and
passion for video games.

I remember at the beginning of the Winter Conference, I gave an
impromptu announcement about the Passion Talks. I polled the audience of
grad students asking, "who here has given a talk before?" Few people
raised their hands. After the Passion Talks, a person commented that, of
course they'd given a talk before, but outside of the familiar context,
it didn't seem like they ever had. We talk about our research when given
permission, and wait for the invitation to speak about the passions in
our lives.

Someone was taking notes

That's what Passion Talks is- the invitation to explain to others why we
live. Towards the people who spoke, it was remarked, that they never
knew that the speakers were capable of giving such talks. Some of the
speakers often kept their passions to themselves, I suppose.

I sat with Brad during dinner, and I believe, he and Marquise were going
to try to do a local version of this at Berkeley. Kassa and I started to
discuss what an actual Passion Talks conference would look like. We
picked the last weekend of July and Stanford as our venue. The response
was overwhelmingly positive. It's funny to think of how little traction
I've had in the last three years for this vision. It seemed like each
year, we'd barely inch forward.

Dinner after the passion talks

If you go to the main page of the site, you will find the Call For
Participation for the Passion Talks event at Stanford in July. To me, it
seems like an obvious thing to do, but we can never fully predict how it
all comes together.

Some of the speakers exchanging ideas with one another

Shortly after the conference, I got this message from Wendy:

> Hey Sherol,
>
> How's it going?
>
> I just wanted to let you know - I'm on an IFES list serve with campus
> workers all over the world, and we're all sharing ways of engaging the
> university.  I told them about the passion talks and they just went
> wild!
>
> They were so excited and some of the groups have already resolved to
> share the idea with their students to try them!
>
> So what you've started here is going international :)
>
> They're a fabulous idea and I'm excited to see if you and Kassa can
> get a conference going in the Summer!
>
> Let me know when you guys want to start working on it.

See you all in July!
