On January 20th, an e-mail went out, titled, "What makes a good Passion
Talk." Such conferences are popping up around the world. So, in a effort
to build the Passion Talks Community there is a page on this [website to
collect information about Passion Talk
events]({{ site.pt14_url }}/passion-talks-international/).

See the message that went out to "a list for IFES-related movements
worldwide."

> -   The talk inspires
> -   The presentation exemplifies a student's faithful development of
>     the gift of an inquiring mind in search of truth and understanding
> -   The presenter does what Jesus, the "Word become flesh" did
>     for us-takes topics often too profound or complex or mysterious
>     for most of us, and finds ways to reach us and give us some
>     understanding of the topic and God's presence it and around it
> -   The talk reveals something about God (his grandeur,
>     creativity, love, compassion) and how he is working in the world,
>     on the campus, in us
