We are expecting people from as north as UC Davis to as south as UC San
Diego flying into the bay area to attend this event. Within the first
day of the Chi Alpha announcement, 110 tickets were already reserved out
of the \~600 seats available.

This is the official announcement from the group hosting Heidi Baker:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chi Alphans,

We mentioned this at the end of last quarter, but now we've got
some details for you.

We will be hosting Heidi Baker at 7pm next Friday (April 13th) in Cemex
Auditorium.

We are doing free tickets for the event - this is to guarantee that
we can offer priority seating to students. We expect a large crowd
as Heidi is very famous within the circles she is famous in. :)

So if you want me to hold a ticket for you, reply and let me know. Also
feel free to have me hold tickets for friends you want to bring. This
will not be a lecture - we will worship and then Heidi will share. Your
non-Christian friends are more than welcome - just be sure that they
know what to expect.

If you are not familiar with Heidi's ministry, she is a
dynamic missionary to Mozambique. Iris Ministries, which she and her
husband founded, feeds 10,000 children a day and has planted over
10,000 churches. Those are not typos. She has a Ph.D. in Systematic
Theology from King's College in London. You can learn more
at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi\_Baker

You should know that while most missionaries have stories of
God's remarkable answers to prayers, Heidi's experience is a step
beyond that. You can get a sense of the sort of stories she might share
at http://www.pneumafoundation.org/resources/articles/MissionsMiracles-HeidiBaker.pdf

P.S. Although the tickets are free, we will ask for a
voluntary, pressure-free \$10 donation at the door - all proceeds beyond
our expenses will go to Iris Ministries.
