# **2009 ------**

I'd like to begin in 2009. Janet and Peter had relocated to this area in
2007 to start a UCSC graduate student ministry. As things got going, I
learned (through them) of the retreat that Berkeley and Stanford hold
every Winter. Probably, I was the most eager to crash that event. Here's
the recap:

# **2010 ------**

As you, who is reading this, may have felt, I've always known there was
something more. In many ways, waiting for it's time to come. In late
2010, these feelings were maturing into ideas, and I wrote a year later
about that experience:

> I'll tell you what it was that I saw... I saw young professionals coming

> upon a unity of love and purpose. In it's early stages, people who
> have been eagerly waiting their call will gather to "set up for the

> technology that stirs a spiritual awakening. People, in my generation,
> have been waiting for their reason to live. At church, we receive
> promise that we are indeed part of something amazing, and yet, have
> settled for the social clubhouse that has become of the western
> church. Deep down, we all know that there is more, but who is willing
> to go prepare for the party? I believe only a few people will
> understand this excitement, and I believe that few will have the great
> privilege to be an integral part of the release of this "something
> amazing."

Winter Retreat, Feb 2010

A couple months later, was the next Winter retreat. At the time, it was
still just Stanford, Berkeley, and a couple UCSC grads.

A couple months later, my friend Tess and I visited our friends at
Stanford for Ethan's [Multi-Faith
Forum](http://blog.ffpaladin.com/2010/06/stanfords-multi-faith-forum/).
It was there that I realized our brothers and sisters at UCSF seem to be
missing from our loosely-held-together cohort.

UCSF Spring Retreat, April 2011

PhD, Masters, and Professional Students gathering from UC Berkeley, UC
Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco, and Stanford. October 2011.

That Summer, we decided to bring the schools together for an intentional
[gathering of prayer, worship, and
sharing](http://blog.ffpaladin.com/2010/11/top-aspiring-experts-and-professionals-gather-at-stanford-to-pray/).
That event summarizes what we are doing right now pretty well. Although,
getting all these people together was no easy task. We had about 30
people at this event- a good distribution over discipline and schools.

> fellowship, UCSF shared about working towards being doctors and
> dentists in San Francisco, Berkeley talked about grad student
> Christian endeavors, and Stanford shared about the number of different
> groups at their school. (11/29/10)

# **2011 ------**

UCSF is in a world of their own, and I had to write an essay of reasons
why they should come visit us in the subsequent Winter Retreat. This was
the first time they'd had UCSF with the other three schools (since I'd
been there). Ethan, from Stanford, thought it would be appropriate to
have people from all schools do worship together. Definitely a step in
the direction I was headed towards.

Hanging out with UCSF, March 2011.

About a month after that, I email the various connections from the
different schools this update:

> students. It's not a matter of being a "bay area" university thing,

# **2012 ------**

Ok, so, we're only 2 months into 2012, and most of the updates have to
do with the Winter Retreat this past month. I'll give a detailed recap
in another post, but for now, I just want to highlight what went on this
time.

Getting dim sum with Brian and Jingyi to catch up with UCSF leaders.
January 2012.

Earlier, in January, I made a trip to see Heidi in San Francisco. While
I was there, I stayed with Johanna, from UCSF. I had met up with a few
of the other UCSF leaders as well. Although, if you hung out with UCSF's
Sonrise Fellowship, you'd soon realize that everyone in that group is a
leader (yea, I know- it's incredible). There I met Steph, who came with
me to meet with Heidi Baker. Right after SF, Steph and I headed to
Stanford to meet with a few select leaders from each of the other 3
schools. At this meeting we finalized details in regards to **April
13th**.

Meeting with leaders from UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco,
and Stanford, with UC San Diego Video Chatting in. January 7, 2012.

On Saturday, Feb 11th, we had a meeting at 4:00 in regards to
"stewarding our influence and vocation." As we were all gathered, we
went around talking about what our research was or what profession we
were working towards and also what we feel called to or what we are
willing to give our lives towards. I made a list of these dreams and
visions. It was indeed a powerful exchange and students found themselves
dreaming the same sorts of dreams and having the tools to realize them.
This was much like the meeting we had about 1.5 years ago with the
initial gathering of the 4 schools.

Winter Retreat meeting of 5 schools: UCB, UCSC, UCSD, UCSF, and
Stanford. Feb 2012.

A lot of this discussion will go on a website soon, as we intend to
continue talking about our dreams and visions. It's through times like
this where people seemed mutually encouraged to fully step into their
calling and "live a life worthy of the calling" we have received. We had
about 20 people from either UCSC, UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford come
together and agree in building a stronger and purposeful community.
