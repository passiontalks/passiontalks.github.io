## Lara Buchak

Assistant Professor of Philosophy

(Ph.D., Princeton University). Her primary research interests are in
decision, game, and rational choice theory. Her book *Risk and
Rationality* (OUP, 2013) concerns how an individual ought to take risk
into account when making decisions. It vindicates the ordinary
decision-maker from the point of view of even ideal rationality. She
also has research interests in the philosophy of religion and in
epistemology. Some topics she has written on include the relationship
between assigning probability to a hypothesis and believing that
hypothesis outright; the conditions under which one ought to stop
looking for more evidence and make a decision; and the nature of faith,
both in the religious and the more mundane sense.
