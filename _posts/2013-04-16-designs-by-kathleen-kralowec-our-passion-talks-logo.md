title: Designs by Kathleen Kralowec - Our Passion Talks Logo
author: Sherol Chen

Part of bringing together a community of awesome and talented people is
seeing how awesomely talented they are. The extent of my graphic design
ability is going to dafonts.com, finding some font, typing in the text,
and taking a screen shot of the (black and white) logo. Luckily, there
are people who committed their lives to understanding art, color
schemes, and typography- here are the professional logo candidates
designed by [Kathleen](http://kkralowec.prosite.com/).
