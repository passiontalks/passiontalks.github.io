# Connecting work and faith

-   Conference Date:   **August, 23rd 2014**
-   Submissions for talks close:   ** July 31st, 2014**
-   Acceptances will be notified on a rolling basis

**Passion Talks** are short talks from Christian academics and
professionals integrating vocation, faith, and passion.

The **Passion Talks Conference** is a forum for grad students, academics
and professionals to share and discuss our work and research, and to
consider how our faith intersects with and impacts upon our work.
Founded in 2012 by Christian grad students from UC Berkeley, UC Santa
Cruz, UC San Francisco, and Stanford, Passion Talks is a growing
platform for considering the work-faith connection in all disciplines.

## **CALLING FOR SUBMISSIONS:**

We are inviting graduate and professional school students of all
disciplines, along with post-grad academics and professionals to submit
