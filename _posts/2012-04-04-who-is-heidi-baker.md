title: Who is Heidi Baker?
author: Sherol Chen
---

Heidi Baker is coming to Stanford on Friday, April 13th. The event
starts at 7:00 and will be in [Cemex
Auditorium](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=cemex+auditorium+stanford&cid=9228248476962410824).
The invitation is going out for students from all Universities, and
especially those in the bay area, to attend. [You might be able to find
free underground parking at the Knight Management Center that can be
accessed via Campus Drive... free parking after 4pm]

Heidi will be giving her firsthand accounts of the breakthroughs she's
experienced within seemingly hopeless situations. Her experiences are
remarkable and inspiring.

The takeaway from this event is for our generation of students, the
aspiring experts and professionals, to realize that the biggest problems
in our world today have solutions and that they are more attainable than
we realize.

Tickets are free and have a \$10 suggested donation. All proceeds over
the cost of the event will go to Iris Ministries - the nonprofit that
Heidi founded and works with.

You do not have to be a student to attend.

Please email chialpha@stanford.edu to reserve tickets.

Here is more of her story...

> Rolland and Heidi Baker began Iris Ministries, Inc., an
> interdenominational mission, in 1980 and have been missionaries for
> the past twenty-five years. They were both ordained as ministers in
> 1985 after completing their BA and MA degrees at Southern California
> College in Biblical Studies and Church Leadership.
>
> Heidi was powerfully called to the mission field when she was sixteen
> and living on an Indian reservation as an American Field Service
> student. She was led to the Lord by a Navajo preacher. Rolland and
> Heidi spent twelve years in Asia. The first six years they led
> Christian dance-drama crusades in Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, and
> Hong Kong. They made use of their backgrounds in creative media and
> the performing arts, and saw thousands come to Jesus.
>
> In 1992 they left to do their PhDs in systematic theology at King's
> College, University of London. At the same time they planted a church
> among the homeless, drug addicts and alcoholics who lived on the
> streets in central London.
>
> In 1995, after twenty years of praying and waiting, they arrived in
> Mozambique, the poorest country in the world. The government offered
> Iris Ministries a horribly delapidated and neglected "orphanage," and
> with no promised support such a project they simply said, "Yes, we'll
> take it!" They began with eighty children, but their hearts were
> broken for the lost and abandoned children still on the streets of
> Maputo. After many years of brutal civil war, thousands left orphaned,
> displaced and abandoned. The Mozambican and foreign staff of Iris
> Ministries began to pick up and take in these lost children. God
> poured down his love and provided food day by day. They grew to 320
> children. They planted a church in the community and began to see
> hundreds turn their hearts to the Lord.
>
> Now, Iris Ministries has expanded to more than six thousand churches
> all over Mozambique and into neighboring countries. Iris now cares for
> almost 4,500 children at its center, and its churches are taking in
> orphans as well. (Expecting Miracles 2007)
>
> [Beginning with nothing, within a matter of months they were given a
> dilapidated orphanage
> in [Maputo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maputo "Maputo") with 80
> children.^[[2]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Baker#cite_note-CBN-1)^ From
> there, the ministry has expanded to include well-drilling, free health
> clinics that service the poor and sick, feeding programs, primary and
> secondary schools, cottage industries and 5000 churches in Mozambique
> and a total of over 8,000 churches in over 20 nations. There are
> multiple 'bases' with [Bible
> schools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_school "Bible school"), as
> well as community outreaches and top-ranked public schools. In
> September 2008 Iris Ministries started a well digging project in
> Northern
