title: Reflections on Heidi Baker's visit to Stanford, 4/13/2012

Of the many talks that I've been to, precious few are student-organized
and bring exceptionally renowned speakers.

<!-- break -->

Heidi Baker's visit to Stanford was the best yet - because of its impact
on those who came.

Heidi Baker shows Christlike humility in her talk at Stanford.

It started with a meeting at 5pm targeted at a group of
grad/professional students and academics who are really interested in
stewarding their professions for the kingdom.

The purpose of the meeting was to share our visions and callings with
each other and with Heidi, and for her to share about needs around the
world and how our training and areas of expertise might help meet these
needs.

I thought it would just be a nice quiet round table and prayer time.
then I saw the videographers, all the cameras and lights set up, and
lots of people. Wow, this is more epic than I thought! You'd think that
history was in the making or something and people were here to capture
it.

Heidi Baker and the rest of us listen to each one share about their
calling and passion for God's kingdom

We initially didn't have so many people signed up, so only set up a
lounge-type of circular area with comfy seating for about 12 people.

Heidi's flight was delayed so she arrived later than expected. When she
arrived, people were quite excited. Though people were a little shy and
we still had extra spots on the couch, so some of the not-much-older
people joined us up front on the comfy seating.

Finally it began. Sherol gave a brief introduction about who we were,
our history, and what we were about, and passed out booklets - very
fancy!

Sherol made booklets describing our history and what we're about, and
the ReClaimTalks project.

Then we each talked about what our callings and passions were - our
missions in life as we understood them.\
 Honestly, the cameras made me nervous, and I found myself not looking
directly at Heidi during most of my couple minutes of sharing, and not
talking about my heart for atheists and agnostics, making an almost
"safe" version of my calling, such as I had recently communicated to
some of my agnostic coworkers.

We went around in turn, each one sharing for a couple minutes. Them,
Heidi shared about her background and some of the needs her org has for
PhD's and professional students.

God had led Heidi and Rolland to give all they had to the poor before
going to Mozambique. God called them to sit with the poor on street
corners, kids taught them Portuguese and the local dialect. Then, after
some time, God moved her to speak. Heidi has been put in jail, and
people have thrown stones at her, she knows what it is like to give her
life for the gospel. She's the wrong race, the wrong gender, the wrong
socio-economic class background to reach these people, but she overflows
with God's love. I was impressed with how humble and and down-to-earth
she was more willing to stop for people than CEOs

Heidi shared that there was a significant need for doctors and health
professionals, as well as engineers. They are even building a university
and have 5 PhD's to be founding instructors, and need 5 more. Heidi
promised that those who went to Mozambique to serve wouldn't starve, and
would have rice and beans or beans and rice depending on the day, and if
they were in the bush they would have a tent, and if they were at a
center they would have a bed - most likely.

She led us in a time of prayer. In her prayer she mentioned how she saw
Jesus standing next to the empty cross, and students coming and laying
their gifts down, some laying down the deeds to their homes - this later
part was the most challenging for me. I mean, I'm living in the black on
a postdoc salary - the thought of earning enough money for a home and
then selling it and using the money to do missions abroad - is something
I've heard of one retired family doing, though it's not for everyone.
Still we are called to live out the good news in a way that often goes
against the world. The prospect of seeing alot of my hard-earned money
go down the drain in end-of-life care and medical expenses isn't very
appetizing either.

After the meeting was over, Heidi hugged each one of us. I was moved to
pray a blessing on Heidi for her to be continually overflowing with the
Spirit of God and with God's love, and I was surprised to feel something
I didn't expect -  her humble acknowledgement of her need for God. Wow,
if Heidi, who is so close to the heart of God's love for the poor and
who sees the Holy Spirit do truly amazing things every week, feels this
deep need for more and more of God, how much more do I need God's
presence ?

I then had the opportunity of riding in the car with Heidi to her talk.
I felt it was underserved that I got this special opportunity , so I
think it highly important to share what I learned. I got to ask her
about how her husband Rolland (a Caltech alum!) was doing, and was glad
to hear that he was doing well.

Someone asked about her wrist support, which was mostly concealed in her
clothing. Her wrist apparently had some injury from her catching people
when they fall down and from baptizing people. What humility and
authentic humanity ... one who sees God do miraculous healings every week
has a hurt wrist because she baptizes people. Yes, God still does
miracles today, but He doesn't give us all the quick healing we might
want - which to me makes the miracles more believable. 2 Cor. 4:7 says
"But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this
all-surpassing power is from God and not from us."

I shared with her how I had a desire to see athiests and agnostics come
to faith in Christ, and about what God was doing in East Asia. I
expressed how I wanted to come to athiests and agnostics not just with
words of earthly wisdom but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power:

^1^ And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I
did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the
testimony about God. ^2^ For I resolved to know nothing while I was with
you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. ^3^ I came to you in weakness
with great fear and trembling. ^4^ My message and my preaching were not
with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's
power, ^5^ so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on
God's power.  (1 Corinthians 2:1-5)

I asked how I might reach out to athiests and agnostics more
effectively. Surprisingly to me, her answer had nothing to do with
miracles or anything like that. A brother mentioned that without faith,
the miracles wouldn't be believed anyway, reminding me of the passage
where Jesus couldn't do many miracles in a certain place (his hometown
if I recall) because people didn't have faith.

Rather, her answer was to do things similar to those I had been taught
to do back in college (and have been trying to do since), so it was
quite encouraging. She said how  even in their missions organization,
about 90% of people come to church and to faith through a Christian
friend. 90% !  I was surprised to find that the big events and epic ways
God shows up for them are actually just a small part of how God shows
people he's real. It's as simple - and as hard - as Jesus's love poured
on people incarnationally through His body. She promoted serving free
food to people on campus going through difficult times such as midterms
and finals, stopping for people, listening to them, giving them our
time, and simply loving them. One thing she said that challenged me the
idea of asking non-Christians what they want prayer for when they're
anxious and fearful (i.e. finals for undergrads). With the current
funding crisis, academics all over the country are fearful and anxious.

At the event venue, we whisked Heidi to a back room where she could have
some alone time with God before her talk. She stopped however to pray
with the worship team beforehand.

Heidi Baker prays with the worship team before the event. I wonder what
the venue's sound guy in the background was thinking when he saw this ...

Worship was great :). Thanks so much Chi Alphans at Stanford for leading
us in worship!

I saw Heidi come out from the back room and go stand in front for the
last half of worship. I noticed that her face was a little reddish. She
must have had an intense prayer time! Her humility and dependence on God
is inspiring. This showed me that she wasn't just treating this like
another talk that so many speakers give. She must have really sought God
to "show up" at the meeting and move in our hearts.

For her talk, she focused on Colossians 1:1-19. She encouraged us to
have "all spiritual wisdom and understanding", and to think like God,
and to seek to feel what He feels. This is difficult and daunting, for
God feels very deeply about all the pain and injustice in the world. But
He has endless joy as well :).

An example of thinking how God thinks. She sees natural disasters and
the like not as causes for bitterness against God, but as opportunities
to serve people and share with them God's love in the midst of crisis.
There is a whole side of Iris ministries, her missions org, devoted to
specifically going into disaster areas and other dark places and sharing
God's love.

Heidi said it matters what you attribute to God, the enemy, and natural
cause. Famine is an opportunity to love more and see God do amazing
things. She doesn't see famine as a time to get angry with God.

> God uses little people like us to be His hands and feet and to love
> people. He wants to break our heart open and let us feel what he
> feels, think what he thinks. [...] If we see what he sees, we'll start
> doing what he does.

... and the we'll find out all things are possible for those who believe,
just as Jesus said.

She also encouraged us to "discover the spiritual quotient" - not sure
what that means, but I think it relates to being fully filled with the
Holy Spirit and soaking in enough of God to feed many many people with
His presence through us.

She mentioned that our sight was limited, that we have spiritual
cataracts - not sure what these are, but perhaps these are related to
our vision being too small?

Heidi is connected to him, in love with Him, and is "Daddy's child".
Heidi shared a story with how she would ride on her father's feet as a
kid. God told Heidi she can do anything....it's all Him, but He chooses to
let us ride on his feet.

Stay tuned for part two!

Thanks to Sherol for providing the photos :).
