The Passion Talks conference was a tremendous success with 17 speakers
flying in from as far as Boston and Phoenix. The conference is being
reported back to a number of communities locally in the Bay Area and
internationally. Below is the schedule of events along with the photos,
and the digital copy of the program can be found

more who registered onsite. The topics went from personal to
professional testimonies spanning the areas of neuroscience, computer
vision, telecommunication, physics, cosmology, humanities, business,
media, and many more. In addition to the professionals, over 5
universities were represented, including MIT, Berkeley, and Stanford.
